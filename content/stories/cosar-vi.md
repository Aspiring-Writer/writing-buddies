The Queen smiled as the prince struggled against his bonds. She had told him that struggling only made it worse and expended his energy; but the Shadow Prince had only scowled at her. Like his father, the prince was stubborn. Yet, unlike his father, the prince had no weaknesses to exploit or an army at his advantage.

The tips of her wings glowed as the electricity in her body charged. Azura took her time approaching the prince, his eyes never leaving her. The Shadow Prince had interesting eyes, ones that did not belong among the fae kind. Only twice in the Histories were the fae rumored to have such eyes, and each time, that fae was either cursed or blessed. Those eyes spoke of untapped power shimmering underneath the surface, power that Azura had yet to see in this particular fae.

*'Faelynn,'* she purred in his ear, *'you know your father isn't coming to rescue you. He has abandoned you, abandoned you to die here in this place.'*

Faelynn continued to struggle against his chains, and the stone that was covered in his blood.

*'Tell me where he is, prince. Tell me, and this will all end.'*

The Shadow Prince stayed silent.

Azura sighed, *'Very well, prince.'* She placed her hands on both sides of his head and released her power. Faelyn screamed and struggled against his bonds as she tore his body apart. A tear slid down Azura's cheek, she wanted this to end, as well.

Faelynn opened his eyes and stared at the sky. A gentle, jasmine-scented breeze caressed his face. Faelynn scoffed, her version of peace was generic.

*'What would you have preferred, prince?'*

He glanced to his left. Azura sat there, watching him with slight curiosity. Faelynn could get lost in her eyes, blue with flecks with white and gray. He tried to sit up and groaned.

*'Why won't you give me what I want?'* She whispered to his mind.

"Why don't you ever speak?" He croaked.

Azura just watched him. Faelynn didn't know how long he had been here, but he had never seen her mouth move, only heard whispers in his mind.

He looked back at the sky, "I will never tell you." He whispered.

*'Then, you will die a miserable death.'*

Faelynn didn't fear death, only wished it came sooner.

*'Your father hates watching you suffer, it angers him that he can't stop it.'*

Faelynn glanced back at her, "My father? He isn't here, how can he be watching me suffer?"

*'He hasn't left your side since the start.'*

Faelynn just stared at her. She looked tired, exhausted even. None of what she was saying made sense.

*'It's not real, you know.'* She smiled sadly, *'It's all in your mind, Faelynn, you can wake up and be free.'*

She had said this before, right after she had electrocuted him for about the fiftieth time. He hadn't understood it then, and he didn't understand it now. "How?" He asked.

*'You have to wake up.'*

He shook his head, "But how? I didn't even know I was sleeping."

*'You must remember, Faelynn, you must remember how you got here, so you can get out.'*

Faelynn stared back at the sky, the clouds drifted by lazily as the birds raced them. He didn't remember much before this, only small fragments. It seemed like the longer he stayed, the more he forgot. The pain, the torture, made everything seem like a distant past.

*'You have to remember before it's too late.'*

Faelynn glanced to his left again. She was gone. He felt a gentle caress on his hair and glanced back up to see Azura within arms-length of him.

*'Remember, my prince.'* She whispered, *'Remember...'*

"Why?" He whispered back, "Why do you want me to escape? I have not given you what you want."

She smiled again, *'I don't know, but I can't watch you die anymore.'*

"Then, just stop."

Her face grew tired and sadness darkened her features, *'It's not that easy, prince. You will understand once you remember and awaken.'*

Faelynn closed his eyes. Her gentle caresses were luring him to sleep.
