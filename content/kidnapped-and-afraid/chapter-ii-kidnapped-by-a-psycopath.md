When I woke up, my head was killing me. Everything was killing me. My back ached and my limbs felt like they were underwater. I moaned and tried to get up. 

*Why is it so dark in here?* I thought.

I reached over for my lamp and felt... nothing. *What happened? Where am I?*

I tried to focus on last night but the banging in my head made that task very difficult. I gave up trying to think and tried to focus on the pitch-black room. My eyes had a hard time focusing. That bothered me. I was used to walking around in the dark, I did it all the time. Why couldn't I see now? I blinked several times. Still nothing. I could barely make out the outline of something a couple of feet in front of me. *The bedpost?*

I scanned the room. Nothing but darkness greeted me. I rubbed my eyes. *Where am I?*

I groaned and rolled over onto my stomach. *This be is so soft and fluffy, like a cloud. Wait, what?* I touched the sheets, *This isn't my bed! Oh, crap, who's bed am I in and why? No, no, no...*

I took a deep breath, *Breathe Marissa, panicking never did you any good. Breathe, relax, think.*

I tried to remember what had happened last night but everything was foggy and my head was killing me.

I heard something, a door? I glanced around the room. There! It was still very dark but I could just make out the outline of a person standing by the bed.

"Who's there?" I tentatively asked.

The figure chuckled and moved.

I swallowed nervously and clutched the blankets to my chest, "Who are you and how did I get here?"

The figure chuckled again, "Need a light, kitten?"

That voice... It was vaguely familiar. That purr... where have I heard it before? My head pounded and I winced.

"Perhaps some aspirin for your headache would be better." He remarked.

"How did you know I had a headache?" I asked.

"Most people have headache's when I'm done with them."

I blinked. I could barely make out the outline of the man who stood a few yards away. His voice was so familiar though I couldn't place where I had heard it before. 

"What do you mean?" I asked, "What do you do to them?"

"I play with their minds."

*Huh? He does what?* "Okay..."

He chuckled, "So oblivious and yet so unafraid."

Yeah, he's crazy and maybe even dangerous. *Carlos was like that.* No. I wasn't going to think about him, I needed to focus on here and now.

"What exactly am I oblivious to?"

Many things," he whispered, "but that shall make this all the more enjoyable."

If my head wasn't already killing me, I would've banged it against a hard object. Instead, I just settled with a groan and pressed my face into the pillows.

I waited a while, listening to hear if Mr. Cryptic left. Then, I felt something touch my hair.

I jumped, "Are you touching my hair?"

"It's soft." He whispered.

I froze as he continued to finger my hair.

"Breathe Marissa." He whispered again.

I jumped, moved to the other side of the bed, and stood up. My head swam but I ignored it. "About that aspirin..." I murmured.

"Come."

I blinked, trying to get my eyes to focus in the darkness. I heard a chuckle and a cool hand touched mine and started pulling me... somewhere.

We walked through a doorway and my eyes made out moonlight shining through a window. It looked like we were in a sitting room. I tried not to focus on the hand that grasped mine, it was cool and calloused.
