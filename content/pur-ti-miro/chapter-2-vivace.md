The hour-long rehearsal with the soprano is Brett’s last musician-duty for the day.

_But do musicians ever stop being musicians when they aren’t playing? Isn’t the mere act of living — an accumulation of experiences — part of practicing?_

Brett catches himself overthinking again.

As he keeps his 1952 Scrollavezza violin into its black case, he overhears one percussionist talking to a couple of wind players.

“She’s cute.”

“Nah, bro. She’s out of your league.”

“I’d take my chance anyway.”

“So you’re asking her out?”

If today were like any other day, Brett would’ve approached his colleagues to spend the rest of the afternoon with them.
The bespectacled guy, who’s turning 33 in a few weeks, just loves talking. Uplifting everyone’s moods is as natural to him as breathing.
He’s a high-pitched laugh track occupying 170 centimeters of horizontal space.

But today is no ordinary day.

Brett takes his phone out of his pocket to message his best friend, Eddy.
The duo — more known for their YouTube moniker TwoSet Violin — have known each other for about a third of their lives now
and somehow they still aren’t tired of each other’s company. Such friendship is a rare treasure. Many envy them.

“DUDE!!!!!!!” Brett couldn’t have sent a more enthusiastic text message.

It’s hard to imagine seeing her again. _Has she been in Australia all along? Since when? For how long?_

During rehearsals, since he saw her walk into the room, the violinist tried so hard to avoid eye contact.
If he looked at her, even for a split-second, and their eyes met, he was certain he wouldn’t have been able to focus on his music.

Brett bids his usual jolly goodbye to his friends then hurriedly leaves, making it appear as if he were rushing to make it to another engagement.
That way, no one asks. It’s a blip in an orchestral musician’s routine, yes, but it’s still somehow usual.

“C’mon, Eddy. Why aren’t you replying!” Brett paces down the stairs as his thoughts race. Every five steps or so, he looks at his phone.
Having learned his lesson from a booboo many years ago, back when he was a rookie musician whose phone rang in the middle of a piano part in rehearsals,
Brett has kept his gadgets on permanent silent mode. But this time, he worries he’d miss Eddy’s text, or call, or reply — _whatever it is,
please, Eddy, make this phone churn a notification._

When the two violinists met Aimee five years ago, Eddy pondered on making her an addition to the video channel they formed in 2014 as stressed-out conservatory students,
which has eventually grown into a community of millions of musicians and classical music fans (called Ling Ling wannabes) all over the world.
Aimee, with her background in television work, would’ve been an invaluable consultant.

More than Aimee’s professional insights, however, Eddy valued the new friendship and company.
Not only is she easy to get along with, but Aimee also blends effortlessly with the both of them. The same passion for music.
The inspiring belief that there’s a bigger purpose in life. The dry humor, though she’s often at the receiving end of the guys’ jokes.
The nuggets of wisdom that helped motivate them to strive to be better than they were yesterday.

Eddy liked her — but five years ago, when she came into their lives, Aimee was on a holiday for only eight days.
The only thing they could do was make the most out of their time with her. Distance is an enemy Eddy wasn’t brave enough to face. Is he any braver now?

Brett can’t help but smile. Having known Eddy since high school, he knows his best friend will be elated by the news, and the suspense is killing him!
Although they rarely spoke about Aimee throughout these years, Brett never really forgot about her and he’s sure his younger friend is the same.

Only five steps away from the exit gate, Brett stops his stirring and looks behind him.

Heading toward him is the same woman occupying his thoughts, still wearing the crisp blazer that singles her out in the sea of summer students.
