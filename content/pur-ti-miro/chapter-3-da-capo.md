**Notes:**
I drew inspiration for this chapter from a few Instagram Stories posted by Brett and Eddy:
those no-context cups of coffee pictures, and the 2020 New Year’s clip when they ordered bubble tea and 143 was their queue number.
(The latter I only faintly recall. It may have happened differently, and my fertile mind embellished it.)

I share the love of bubble tea with Brett and Eddy. Let this be my tribute to the best drink ever invented. ;)

---

“Hey! You’re Brett from TwoSet, right?”

The male violinist turns his head with a fake smile. Those six words take him by surprise.

_How does one react when someone you know so well — or used to know — seems to have forgotten about you? Do friends become strangers by not seeing each other?_

The woman in heels, now standing at the same height as the older man, stares at him, waiting for a reply.
Whatever he says now will determine their future interactions, and she’s hoping she won’t be just another soloist
who passes by his life only for the sake of a performance.

Brett decides to play it safe. “Yeah! By the way, you were really great earlier. We were all astonished!”
This is their first conversation after an uncomfortable silence that spanned five years. _How can it be any less awkward?_

“Thanks!” The singer smiles back, but it was not the response she expected to hear.
“I guess you don’t remember me then,” she shrugs and whispers, but her disappointed tone was audible.

That’s his cue. His eyes widen. His deep voice picks up a higher pitch. “Of course I remember you, Aimee! How can I forget?”

Aimee’s face brightens up.

“Do you have plans tonight? Wanna go to that milk tea place where we met, uh, six, five years ago?”

“Sure! That’ll be nice.”

* * *

Eyes staring blankly, face looking pale and white, Aimee stood by the receiving counter as she waited for her wintermelon bubble tea.

The barista placed the plastic cover over the large cup then pushed a button on the table. The number 143 flashed on the screen.

Just as she stretched her right hand to receive her quencher, a man from her left side grabbed the plastic cup. They were both surprised. T
he man, who looked about the same age as her, observed her for a few seconds. Her furrowed eyebrows met in a single line.
In unison, their eyes scrutinized their respective receipts then eagerly showed the piece of paper to the other person.

Both man and woman were confused. Separately, they ordered a large wintermelon bubble tea with extra tapioca pearls, yet their billings both showed 143.

“Must be a glitch in the system. We’re sorry for this inconvenience. I’ll make sure to report this to IT.
Please wait and I’ll prepare the other wintermelon bubble tea for you,” the male staff said.

“No problem, Jack.” she livened up her voice, but her sweet-looking face couldn’t hide the dismay.
The taller man wondered how she knew his name. _Is she a regular here?_

“Hey! Uh, you can take this,” the man said.

“You sure?”

“Yeah, I’ll just wait for the other one.”

Aimee returned the kindness with a gentle thanks, but she was too preoccupied to even bother looking up at his face.
She went back to her seat where she left her two luggage and a backpack. She took her MacBook out, plugged her earphones, and fell silent.

A little while later, a familiar voice spoke to her. “Hi. Is this seat taken? Everywhere else is occupied.”

She removed her backpack from the otherwise empty chair and set it on her lap. “No, not really. Please have a seat. I don’t mind.”
The sound of her voice jived with the noise of her computer keyboard as she typed away.

It took maybe five seconds until she glanced back at the face of the stranger, who was now sitting in front of her with eyes twinkling as he sipped his milk tea.
The woman in her late 20s squinted, first to shake off the exhaustion from a long-haul flight, then in utter disbelief.

“Brett! Of TwoSet Violin!”

She might have spoken too loudly. In embarrassment, she lowered her voice. “It’s you, right?”

* * *

Eyes on the road, hands on the steering wheel, Brett laughs boisterously. “You looked very tired then! I wasn’t sure if you would engage in small talk.
You know, it took you a while to recognize me. And it’s funny because from the counter
I already knew you were a fan because you were wearing our limited edition 2-mil-subs Tchaik shirt!”

“When we were comparing receipts, I was waiting for you to recognize me. But you didn’t.
So I thought maybe you were gifted that shirt and aren’t really familiar with us,” he continues.

Aimee, sitting on the passenger seat, turns red. “Exactly why I was there! I badly needed the sugar rush, duh!”

The two friends who have long been apart relish each other’s company with nostalgia and hearty laughters.

“It took me several months and follow-up emails to get that shirt. Terrible delay because of the pandemic. I thought I’d never get what I paid for.”

“Really? You never told us that story.”

“Haven’t I? You nearly lost a fan there!” she chuckles. “Well, I emailed TwoSet Apparel support and they were gracious and helpful.”

Brett, co-owner of the apparel company catering to musicians, smirks.

“Your staff deserve a raise!”

“I’ll let Eddy know!”

_Is this man even aware his pitch goes higher when he’s excited or having too much fun?_ Aimee has always liked seeing him this way.

* * *

“I’m sorry I didn’t notice you earlier. I was —”

Brett didn’t even allow her to finish her apology. “Don’t worry about it. You looked like you needed sleep.” He laughed.
It’s the same animated laughter from their YouTube videos, only this time she was hearing it live.

Seeing the suitcases surrounding his new acquaintance, the violinist couldn’t help but ask, “So where are you headed?”

“Oh, I arrived this morning. I’m waiting for the hotel check-in, but I saw this place and thought I’d hang out here.”
The younger woman removed her earphones and closed her laptop.

“Hey, I didn’t mean to bother you. You can go on with whatever you’re doing.”

“I just finished my work so it’s fine.”

“Great,” there was something drawing Brett to this woman. _Could it simply be curiosity?_
It’s the first time he met a female fan — and actually talking and sitting next to her — who didn’t swoon or fluster at the sight of him.
Brett and his best friend Eddy were both aware their fans have the tendency to be rabid and a bit too enthusiastic.
It took some getting used to; all the attention made them uncomfortable at first, but they deeply appreciate and love their fans.

“I see. Where have you been? And what brings you here in Brisbane?”

Her eyes gleamed. “It’s a long story. Do you have time for it?”

_This is unusual,_ Brett thought. The fans they got to meet were often either excited and inquisitive or shy and awkward.
Brett and Eddy would usually do most of the talking to help make their fans at ease, but the woman before her was calm and steady.

“I do. Please go on and tell me your story.”

The woman took a sip of bubble tea. Water droplets outside her cup trickled down. She was about to say her first word when Brett interrupted her.

“I’m sorry. Before you start, may I just borrow your bubble tea so I could take a picture of these two,” referring to the 143 stickers on both of their cups.

“And post it on social media? What a tease!” The woman rolled her eyes and chuckled.

“Shush!” Brett grinned from ear to ear as he was looking down and typing on his phone. “Sorry about that. Please continue.”

”I haven’t even started yet!” Her giggles felt warm. Brett couldn’t keep himself from smiling. She then talked about Iran where she had recently been for work.
As a journalist, she investigated and reported about the true impact of the pandemic in the country, one that’s been allegedly censored by the government
in the midst of the global health crisis. Her words flowed like musical phrases to Brett’s ears.
Even for someone who couldn’t care less about politics, Brett yearned to learn more about the situation.

Their conversation went smoothly from one topic to the next that they hardly noticed time passing by until a phone ring broke the harmony in their laughter. It was Eddy. The woman fell silent to let Brett take the call.

“Hey, uhm, I hope you don’t think I’m crazy or anything, but I’m meeting Eddy in a bit. If you have no plans today, maybe you’d like to join us?”

The woman didn’t expect this. She’s been a TwoSet Violin fan for years, but while she has always wanted to meet the two classical musicians,
life got in the way: work had made her terribly busy, and the violinists’ world tour was postponed due to the coronavirus disease outbreak.

“We’re filming some stuff, but I promise I’ll bring you to your hotel after.”

“Are you kidding me?” Her exuberant tone was like a breaking character. “Of course! I’d love to!”

The two new friends stood up. Before Brett got hold of the woman’s luggage to help her load her things into his car, she asked for a favor:
_a selfie, please, to remember this moment by._

They held their cups, both nearly empty and identified with 143, and posed for a picture.
“Don’t worry, I won’t be posting this and counter your social media strategy,” she winked.

_For all you know, that post wasn’t for the fans but for Eddy._

* * *

The unexpected catch-up took hours of reminiscing. Finally, Brett assists Aimee out of her chair like a true gentleman.

“What happened? You were never this formal!”

“I know! I even forgot to ask your name the first time we met!”

The singer and violinist spend the entire time laughing, pausing only to exchange a few words, only to then laugh again.
It’s as if the five years of losing touch with each other are a figment of the imagination.

Aimee gives Brett a quick hug by her doorstep after he drops her off her apartment.
He leaves smiling at the knowledge they will be seeing each other again tomorrow for the rehearsals.

But there’s a nagging feeling he may have forgotten something. Upon arriving home, he checks his phone: 37 missed calls from Eddy.

“Oh, shi—.”
