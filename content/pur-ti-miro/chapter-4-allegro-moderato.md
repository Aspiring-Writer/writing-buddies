**Notes:**
Hello! This is my first attempt at creating a fluff piece — I’m not even sure if I did it correctly — as well as the first time I’m writing in Eddy’s perspective. The previous chapters had been narrated through the eyes of Brett and Aimee. In writing this chapter, I realized I can “connect” with Brett more easily, perhaps because we are both *NFPs. (He is said to be an ENFP, while I am an INFP in the Myers-Briggs personality typing. I am not sure if it works that way, though. LOL.)

Please leave some feedback. It will mean a lot to fan fic newbie me.

(See the end of the chapter for more notes.)

Eddy forces himself out of bed. He has never been an early riser, unlike his best friend Brett, who regularly wakes up at 9 a.m. regardless of how much sleep he had the night or morning before, as if it were programmed in his body.

The somnolent summer afternoon only makes it more difficult for the tall violinist to be productive,
but he decides it will be a disservice to their millions of fans if he skips practice — TwoSet Violin’s catchphrase.

He shuffles to the white-walled music room, where they also usually film their videos, and lays a notebook on the table.
Scratching his nose, he begins writing a list of ideas for their growing channel’s future content:

- A bubble tea-drinking video, like one of those “Never Have I Ever” games but something different. Fans like those.
It’s been many years since we did something like it.

- If _______ Were A Film, similar to the one we made about Philip Glass’s “Opening”. But which piece?

- Schumann vs Brahms diss track (???). Maybe not a diss track because they were friends, but something about them fighting for the love of Clara.

- Trying to make a violin, with the help of Olaf

“Bro, this will be so hard to make!” Eddy thinks out loud, addressing the image of Brett in his mind.
Most of their waking hours are spent either physically together or communicating in whatever means. Over the years, they are like an extension of each other.

In a previous discussion, Brett and Eddy had agreed to uploading a more diverse content on their channel, giving the fans something to look forward to,
some kind of a surprise in a sea of familiarity.

“We can’t keep roasting. We’re a classical music channel, not a roasting channel,” he remembers his older friend making the declaration.
It’s a line they keep saying on their review videos, but they both know the frequency of their saying these words does not make it true.

Eddy laughs to himself. “Damn, I wish Brett were here.” He smiles, recalling an instance in the past when he had felt the same sense of frustration:
that was when he had to make a “OneSet Violin” video because Brett came from the hospital and, due to health safety protocols, had to be quarantined.
Their fans worried a lot despite his words of reassurance that Brett was fine.

This is different though. They won’t be talking for only one day, as Brett had earlier reminded Eddy that he has a full rehearsal schedule.
“Don’t think I’m ignoring you, bro. We’ll see each other the day after, anyway.”

That Brett auditioned for and got accepted in projects back in the orchestra surprised Eddy —
his friend hadn’t informed him because he wasn’t sure he’d get in anyway — but he had always sensed an inkling this could happen.
His more extroverted friend is always on the lookout for new experiences, and a decade of YouTube content creation can become routinary and boring,
no matter how much they try to mix things up.

Eddy continues his list:

- A collab with Hilary… but what? (This has to wait until the world tour.)

- Violin swap! We finger each other’s G strings — I mean, we play each other's violins!

Eddy smiles at the thought of the last item.

It takes him fifteen minutes to finish compiling his ideas for the video channel he shares with his long-time best friend.
At the back of his mind, he hopes this productivity will make Brett proud.

Eddy imagines telling Brett about this list tomorrow. “Man! These are all great!” Brett would have said,
with a wide grin that the public rarely sees in their videos but he so often witnesses in their private moments.

Brett would run his fingers through his hair as he continued reading Eddy’s plans for their channel.
The younger violinist would stare lovingly at the other’s eyes, yearning for some form of validation.
He would marvel at the architecture of Brett’s nose, tracing every millimeter down to the pink, supple lips.

Then, Brett would turn his face to Eddy and say, “I can’t believe you did all this!”
His words were like hymns of angels to Eddy’s ears. He would plant his hand on Eddy’s shoulder, moving his friend closer to him.

Eddy bites the corner of his mouth to shake off the vivid daydream. “Time to practice!” he convinces himself.

Eddy begins with half an hour of scales, the most boring yet essential part of his practice routine.
Then, he takes his sheet music and flips to a difficult part in Sibelius’ only violin concerto.
The duo will be playing an excerpt in their upcoming world tour as a treat to their fans.

“They can’t understand that Sibelius is too hard!” Eddy whines for a while then composes himself to tackle the dreaded piece.

Every few bars, Eddy pauses and thinks of what Brett could be doing now.
He imagines his best friend in the practice hall alongside other orchestral musicians, his eyes intensely focused on the notes dancing on the staves in his sheet music,
as he plucks the violin strings with his delicate fingers. Oh, how he longs to be touched by those fingers.

Eddy sighs.

This cycle of deliberate practice and wild imaginings took about three hours and Eddy hadn’t noticed.
He finally stops because he’s feeling hungry. After packing his violin into its case, he checks his phone and is flustered that he missed Brett’s text message an hour ago.
It reads: “DUDE!!!!!!!”

What the hell was that? No follow-up text. Couldn’t he have rung his phone instead?

Eddy becomes frantic. He blames himself for setting his phone on silent during practice time.
He makes a mental note not to do this again, or at least make an exemption for Brett.

“Hey, what’s up?” he replies.

No immediate response.

“Sorry, I was busy practicing and didn't notice your text. Aren’t you supposed to be in rehearsals? You bum!”

Eddy decides to wait for ten minutes. Brett must still be in rehearsals and is unable to check his phone. It’s on silent mode, probably.

He checks every so often even as he entertains himself with the latest Smash Bros. But nada. That’s how his panic starts building up.
He makes his first call. Brett’s phone rings but there’s no answer.

Then, another call. And another. And another.

What could’ve happened to Brett? Beads of sweat appear on Eddy’s forehead and nose bridge.
Unconsciously, he purses his lips in worry. He can feel his heartbeat racing and his mind swirling.

 “Bro, pick up. I’m getting worried. Or at least send me a text if you’re still busy.”

“Heyyyyyy.”

“Where the hell are you, man?”

“What’s with the text?”

“DUDE!!!!! Answer the freakin’ phone!”

Knowing he couldn’t do anything because he has no idea where Brett is — rehearsals should’ve been over by now — Eddy tells himself if anything went awry,
Brett would’ve called him immediately. Maybe this is a non-issue. One of those pranks. _Brett will have it tomorrow._
Eddy puts his right hand over his chest, mentally counting the tempo of his heart beat. “Dude, this isn’t healthy for me. Please call back.”
Even in solitude, he holds back his tears. He knows he shouldn’t be feeling this intensely for a friend, even if he’s someone he has known for more than half his life.
With these thoughts, Eddy falls asleep.

It must’ve been hours of deep slumber when he wakes up to the sound of his phone ringing.
Eddy jumps out of bed and picks up in a flash. “WHAT THE HELL, MAN! YOU CAN’T JUST SEND ONE TEXT WITH NO FOLLOW-UP, NO REPLY, NO CALL BACK.”

He takes a deep breath to calm himself. “I was so worried, you know.”

Brett, on the other line, just laughs at this impassioned greeting. “Woah, bro! Chill out, will you?”

Eddy hides his frustration with a coy grunt and lets Brett explain his side.

“I’m sorry I wasn’t able to take your call. You know, it’s on silent. I don’t even bother changing the settings now anymore.
And I’m totally fine so don’t you worry. Anyway, it’s past midnight so I’ll save the story for later. You were probably sleeping before I called anyway.
Just wanted to confirm we’re still on for tomorrow afternoon’s filming, right?”

“Yeah, yeah. Tomorrow.” Eddy fakes the breathiness in his voice to give an illusion of drowsiness.

“Great. See you then! I’ve got a surprise for you.”

Eddy’s eyes opened widely, and he cares not to make an audible gasp. _What surprise could that be? Was that why Brett had been out of reach for hours?_
Still, he can’t risk blowing off his facade. He pretends to be unaffected.

“Right, yeah. So tomorrow,” he fakes a yawn. “Bro, gotta sleep.”

“Yeah, sorry, man. Just wanted to let you know I’m fine, everything’s fine.”

“Good night, Brett.”

“Night, Eddy. I’ll see you tomorrow.”

Eddy darts back to bed with a wide grin on his face. He can’t contain his excitement for what may come tomorrow. •
